# Infected-Multiplayer

**Description**

Infected-Multiplayer is a work in progress PC & mobile cross-platform game that utilizes Photon Unity Networking (PUN) and was originally inspired by one of my favorite Call of Duty game modes "Turned" where players can play as zombies and compete against each other to hunt down the lone human survivor.
